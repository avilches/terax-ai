# Terax — Backend IPC surface

All Tauri commands registered in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` via `tauri::generate_handler![]`. The WebView calls them via `invoke()` from `src/lib/native.ts` — never use `invoke()` directly in components or hooks.

Adding a new command requires three steps: `Cargo.toml` dependency (if a new plugin), `.plugin(...)` call in `lib.rs` `run()`, and a capability entry in `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`.

## `pty::*` — PTY sessions

State: `PtyState = RwLock<HashMap<id, Session>>`

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `pty_open` | Spawn a new PTY session, returns a Tauri `Channel<PtyEvent>` for streaming output |
| `pty_write` | Write bytes to a PTY (keyboard input) |

| `agent_enable_claude_hooks` | Atomically install Claude Code terminal hooks |
| `agent_claude_hooks_status` | Query whether hooks are installed |

## Terminal agent notification protocol

Terax passively monitors terminal panels for coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) using OSC sequences. No configuration is required — detection arms itself automatically once a compatible agent is detected.

### How it works

1. Claude Code (or a compatible agent) installs Terax hooks via `agent_enable_claude_hooks`. These hooks emit an `OSC 777` marker through the hook's `terminalSequence` field (hooks lost `/dev/tty` access in Claude Code v2.1.139).
2. The OSC 777 marker self-arms `agent_detect.rs` in the PTY byte reader. The detector tracks the agent's state via subsequent OSC sequences.
3. OSC 133;C (command prompt shown) arms the detector. Subsequent hook events transition the state machine: `started` / `working` / `attention` (needs user input) / `finished` / `exited`.
4. The frontend `AgentNotificationsBridge.tsx` maps these state transitions to the notification router (`lib/route.ts`):
   - Panel is focused and visible: suppress (user is already watching)
   - Window is not focused: send an OS notification
   - Window is focused but the panel is hidden: show a Sonner toast
5. The `NotificationBell` in the header aggregates status across all active terminal agent sessions.

### Zero cost when idle

The detection logic runs entirely on the PTY byte filter. When no agent is running, no extra work is done. There are no polling timers or background requests.

### Installing hooks

Hooks can be installed from within the app (the notification bell popover shows a "Set up Claude Code" prompt if hooks are not yet installed). The installer (`agent_enable_claude_hooks`):
- Reads the existing Claude Code `settings.json` atomically
- Injects the `terax:agent-signal` hook entries without overwriting unrelated settings
- Is idempotent — re-running it on an already-configured installation is safe
